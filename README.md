A quick recipe book showcasing my first html project.

To easily identify what skills I am practicing in this project I have listed them here.

1. Practiced using Git and Github for the first time, creating a new repository, committing valuable changes, proper commit comments for longevity
2. Practice HTML; creating HTML boilerplate, proper file structure, links (relative), images, paragraphs
3. Practice CSS; adding borders, creating ids and classes, font families, button appearance, image sizing
