    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These cookies are a crowd pleaser, and easily modified! To keep cookies from cooking flat, 
        make sure to cream the butter with the sugar (don't melt your butter!) And if you have time, 
        refrigerate the dough before baking, and between batches.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>

        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
